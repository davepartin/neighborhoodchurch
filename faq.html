                <div class="faq-question">What time is the Sunday service?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">Our Sunday worship service begins at 10:30 AM. Coffee and connection start at
                    10 AM, so feel free to come early and grab a cup before things get started. We also have Morning
                    Discipleship Groups at 9 AM for men, women, young adults, and youth. The service typically wraps

                <div class="faq-question">Is there parking?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes — we have a free parking lot right at our building at 8600 W 91st Terrace,
                    Overland Park, KS 66212. There are no reserved spots, so just find any open space when you arrive.
                    Accessible parking is available near the entrance.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">What should I wear?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">Come as you are — seriously. You'll see everything from jeans and t-shirts to
                    dresses and button-ups. We care about your heart, not your wardrobe. Whether you're coming straight
                    from the gym or dressed for brunch, you'll fit right in. What matters most is that you're here.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What's the service like?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">Our service is casual and warm. We sing together with contemporary worship music,
                    pray, hear a sermon taught through books of the Bible, and regularly share communion. The teaching
                    is conversational and practical — expect seminary-level depth delivered with everyday clarity.
                    We're not flashy, but we are genuine.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Will I have to stand out or introduce myself?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">Absolutely not. We're glad you're here, but we won't put you on the spot. You're
                    welcome to connect at your own pace. If you want to meet people, we'll introduce you. If you'd
                    rather observe quietly, that's completely fine too.</p>

                    rooms. Kids in Kindergarten through 5th grade worship with the family during the first part of the
                    service and then head to age-appropriate classes during the sermon where they learn about Jesus
                    through engaging lessons and activities. All of our volunteers are background-checked and passionate

                <p class="faq-answer">Absolutely not — you are welcome wherever you are on your spiritual journey. We
                    love honest questions and believe that curious seekers are in exactly the right place. You won't be
                    pressured, put on the spot, or made to feel like an outsider. Come with your doubts, your questions,
                    and your curiosity. We're honored to be part of your journey.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">What kind of church is Neighborhood Church?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">We are a gospel-centered, Southern Baptist church in Overland Park, Kansas. We
                    believe the Bible is the inspired Word of God, that Jesus died and rose again for our sin, and that
                    the local church is the hope of the world. We partner with the North American Mission Board and the
                    International Mission Board. We're relational, multigenerational, and deeply committed to loving God
                    and loving our neighbors — not just as a tagline but as a way of life. You can read more on our

                <div class="faq-question">Do you have small groups or community groups?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes — we call them Neighborhood Groups and they're the heartbeat of how we do
                    life together outside of Sunday. Groups meet in homes around the Overland Park area for Bible study,
                    prayer, and genuine friendship. It's where people really get to know each other and grow together.
