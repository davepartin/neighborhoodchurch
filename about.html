            <div class="value-card">
                <h3>Loving God</h3>
                <p>We want to be satisfied in God and live our lives to glorify Him. The gospel forms our new identity
                    as sons and daughters of the King. As we grow in our relationship to the Father, we shape our values
                    and worldview based on God's plan found in His Word. The core of discipleship is helping each other
                    understand and abide in the truth of who we are in His Kingdom.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="value-card">
                <h3>Loving Our Neighbors</h3>
                <p>We want to bless our neighbors. John 1:14 in The Message it says, "The Word became flesh and moved
                    into the neighborhood." We want to follow God's heart by making our homes lighthouses on our streets
                    and living as missionaries in our neighborhoods. We are compelled by His love to make sacrifices for
                    those with physical and spiritual needs throughout our city and world.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="value-card">
                <h3>Together</h3>
                <p>We belong to a spiritual family by living life together. Our Neighborhood Groups will be the main
                    environment where life-on-life discipleship will take place. As we spend time serving together, we
                    expose our brokenness, and the gospel is worked out through our relationships. We will remind each
                    other constantly that we are loved, adopted, and forgiven by our Father.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="value-card">
                <h3>Hospitality</h3>
                <p>Our hope is that our homes will be open and the primary place for our neighbors to experience love
                    and inclusive community. Our gatherings and parties will have a hospitable posture so we can be
                    confident that our friends will be accepted and loved wherever they are on their spiritual journey.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="value-card">
                <h3>Neighborhood Focused</h3>
                <p>A neighborhood is transformed when a group of Christians love and serve their neighbors. A community
                    is transformed when a group of neighborhoods love and serve the community. A city is transformed
                    when a group of communities love and serve the city together.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="value-card">
                <h3>Multiplication</h3>
                <p>We want to multiply by making "disciple-making" disciples and planting "church-planting" churches.
                    Whenever possible we want to use transferrable methods to train and empower others to go and
                    multiply.</p>

                <h3>Partnerships</h3>
                <p>We want to multiply by making "disciple-making" disciples and planting "church-planting" churches. We
                    are a Southern Baptist Church that partners with the North American Mission Board with the Send

            <span class="section-tag">What We Believe</span>
            <h2>Our Beliefs</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">We agree with the <a href="http://www.sbc.net/bfm2000/bfm2000.asp" target="_blank"
                    style="color: var(--nc-green); text-decoration: underline;">Baptist Faith and Message 2000</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-item">
            <h3>The Scriptures</h3>
            <p>We believe only the 66 books of the Bible are the inspired, and therefore inerrant, Word of God. These
                books were written by divinely inspired men and are God's revelation of Himself to man. Inspiration
                extends to the very words of Scripture, not just its teachings, and to everything in the Bible, not just
                the portions that pertain to matters of faith and practice. The Scriptures are inerrant in the sense
                that the Scriptures in the original manuscripts are true in all that they say, therefore without error.
                They are necessary and clear for knowing the gospel, maintaining spiritual growth and knowing God's
                will. They are sufficient for all that God requires us to believe and do and are the supreme standard by
                which all human conduct, creeds, and religious opinions should be tried.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-item">
            <h3>The Triune God</h3>
            <p>We believe in one God who exists eternally in three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. All three are
                co-eternal, co-existent, and co-equal. The Father is not the Son and the Son is not the Holy Spirit, yet
                each is truly God. One God - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit - is the foundation of the Christian faith and
                life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-item">
            <h3>God The Father</h3>
            <p>We believe God the Father is the creator of heaven and earth. By His word He freely and supernaturally
                created the world out of nothing. Through the same word, He daily sustains all His creatures. He rules
                over all His creation along with the flow of human history according to His good pleasure and sovereign
                will. His plans and purposes cannot be thwarted. In His unfathomable grace and love, He gave His Son
                Jesus Christ for mankind's redemption. His ultimate purpose in all things is His own praise and glory.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-item">
            <h3>Jesus Christ</h3>
            <p>We believe Jesus is the eternal Son of God, fully God and fully Man. In His incarnation, Jesus was
                conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. Although He took on human flesh He never
                ceased to be fully God, lived a perfectly sinless life, and offered Himself as a penal substitutionary
                sacrifice for the sins of all people by dying on a cross. He was raised from the dead three days later
                in a literal physical body demonstrating His power over sin and death. He then ascended into heaven
                forty days later and was seated at the Father's right hand where He now intercedes for His people and
                rules as Lord over all. He will someday return in bodily form to judge the world and reign as King in a
                new heaven and a new earth for all eternity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-item">
            <h3>The Holy Spirit</h3>
            <p>We believe the Holy Spirit, through the proclamation of the gospel, supernaturally convicts men of sin
                and regenerates the hearts of God's people by making alive what was spiritually dead. At the point of
                conversion the Holy Spirit unites the believer into the body of Christ, indwells them, and seals them
                unto the day of redemption. The Spirit then fills the believer, causes him to grow in holiness, and
                equips him with spiritual gifts for the building up of the body of Christ.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-item">
            <h3>Man</h3>
            <p>We believe man and woman were the crown of God's good creation, being created in His own image,
                originally righteous and without sin. However, because of Adam's disobedience the human race has fallen
                resulting in all of mankind being born into this world absolutely depraved, corrupted with sin, and
                alienated from God. Mankind therefore is subject both to imputed and inherent sin and is therefore by
                nature and choice deserving of God's just wrath. Humans are unable to save themselves or contribute in
                any way to their acceptance before God and are in desperate need of a Savior.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-item">
            <h3>The Way of Salvation (The Gospel)</h3>
            <p>We believe that Christ's life, death, and resurrection is the good news of the gospel and provides the
                way of salvation for sinful man. Christ's death is a substitutionary and propitiatory sacrifice to God
                for our sins. On the cross Jesus vicariously bore the exact punishment for sins in the place of sinners
                thereby satisfying the demands of God's holy justice and appeasing His holy wrath - and gloriously
                demonstrating His mysterious love and amazing grace. Christ and His work on the cross alone is the basis
                for our salvation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-item">
            <h3>Man's Response to the Gospel (Faith and Repentance)</h3>
            <p>We believe the proper response to the gospel is faith in the person and work of Jesus Christ - a faith
                that must naturally be accompanied by repentance from sin. Biblical repentance is characterized by a
                changed life and saving faith is evidenced by a life of kingdom service and good works. God alone
                because of His mercy and sovereign election through the power of the Holy Spirit can awaken this
                response of faith and repentance. While neither repentance nor works save, they are the evidence that
                one's heart has truly been regenerated.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-item">
            <h3>Man's Inheritance Through the Gospel</h3>
            <p>We believe salvation is provided by grace alone, through faith alone, because of Christ alone, for the
                glory of God alone. Anyone turning from sin in repentance and relying solely upon Christ and His
                substitutionary death, looking to Christ alone for their righteousness, receives the gift of eternal
                life and is declared righteous by God - having the righteousness of Christ imputed to him. He is
                justified and fully accepted by God. Through Christ's atonement for sin he is completely forgiven the
                debt of his sin, reconciled to God as Father, and adopted as His beloved child. Once salvation is
                obtained it cannot be lost. Those who are truly redeemed are kept by God's power and therefore secure in
                Christ forever.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-item">
            <h3>Sanctification</h3>
            <p>We believe sanctification is a progressive work of God and man through the presence and enabling power of
                the Holy Spirit that makes us more and more free from sin and like Christ in our actual lives. Although
                the process is continuous in this life it is never completed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-item">
            <h3>The Church</h3>
            <p>We believe the Church universal is made up of those from all the nations, both living and dead, who have
                genuinely repented of their sins and trusted in Christ alone for their salvation. A local church is an
                autonomous group of baptized believers who have covenanted together as the church under identifiable
                church leadership. Local churches gather together regularly to celebrate the life, death, and
                resurrection of Jesus Christ. This is accomplished through the observance of the ordinances of baptism
                and the Lord's supper, the worship of God through Jesus Christ, the preaching and teaching of the Word
                of God, and the exercise of spiritual gifts and service leading to the edification of the body of
                Christ. Local churches then scatter into the world for the purpose of making disciples of all nations.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-item">
            <h3>The Ordinances of the Church</h3>
            <p>Water baptism and the Lord's Supper are the two ordinances given to the church to be observed until
                Christ returns. Water baptism involves a believer being completely immersed under water in the name of
                the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This ordinance has no saving power yet symbolizes the
                believer's union with Christ in his death, burial, and resurrection. It signifies that one's former way
                of life has been put to death, that one is released from the mastery of sin, and that one has entered
                into a new life of obedience and faith. The Lord's Supper is a symbolic act of obedience whereby
                believers, by partaking of the bread and the cup, remember the death of the Lord Jesus Christ,
                anticipate His second coming, and signify our unity with other members in the body of Christ. The bread
                is symbolic of Christ's body and the cup represents His blood.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-item">
            <h3>Last Things</h3>
            <p>Jesus Christ will return to earth personally, visibly, and bodily as King of Kings and Lord of Lords. At
                his appearing the dead shall be raised in bodily form and the living and the dead will be judged. The
                wicked and unbelieving will be consigned to hell, a place of eternal conscious punishment. Those
                belonging to Jesus will have eternal life in the new heavens and the new earth and live in
                ever-increasing joy to the glory of God.</p>

                    by living with gospel intentionality.</p>
                <p>We are on a journey of grace where God has used His Word, many loving leaders, friends and family,

                <h2>The Early Years</h2>
                <p>We grew up in West Tennessee, where Rivers and I both put our faith in Jesus while in middle school.
                    We were married in 1998 and began our journey of ministry together at Beaver Baptist Church. This is
                    where I felt my call to full-time ministry and was licensed to preach.</p>
                <p>We then moved to Kansas City to work with Young Life. This ministry taught us to go and meet people
                    where they are and bring Jesus to them. In 2002, I accepted the High School Student Director
                    position at Covenant Chapel. These seven years were an impactful season of learning to shepherd
                    others and develop ministry plans centered on the Gospel.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h2>From Budapest to Pennsylvania</h2>
                <p>In 2009, we were sent to serve in Budapest, Hungary with Cru. These four years deepened our love for
                    healthy team ministry. We saw evangelism and discipleship modeled in relational environments like
                    never before. During our time in Hungary, our conviction was solidified: the local church is the
                    primary means to reaching the world.</p>
                <p>In 2013, we moved to Harrisburg, PA, to help an Acts 29 church plant called Liberti. There, we
                    focused on leadership development, student ministries, and shepherding small group leaders to live
                    missionally.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h2>Planting Deep Roots</h2>
                <p>In May 2015, I graduated from Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Kansas City. Our prayer
                    times and conversations with leaders continued to affirm a call to plant a new gospel-centered,
                    missional church.</p>
                <p>The reality that ten American churches close their doors every day while only three start weighed
                    heavily on us. The need in Kansas City, paired with our previous eight years of living here, led us
                    to Overland Park.</p>
                <p>In the fall of 2015, we partnered with the North American Mission Board, Westside Family Church, and
                    the New Thing Church Planting Network to begin Neighborhood Church.</p>
